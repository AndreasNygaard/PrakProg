##### Working directory for Practical Programming and Numerical Methods #####


### ________ SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS ________ ###


To use this directory, one must meet the following software requirement:

- GNU make
- Csharp mono
- Gnuplot (with cairo)
- GCC (for the "Exercises" directory)
- latex

If something doesn't function properly, consider updating these softwares

When using gnuplot figures in latex documents, the gnuplot terminal is set
to pngcairo. A new update has caused some problems on OS X, but it should
function properly with Ubuntu and other Linux distributions. A solution
for OS X users is to install a prevoius version of a gnuplot dependency:

	brew uninstall --ignore-dependencies pango
	brew install iltommi/brews/pango




### ________ INSTRUCTIONS FOR USAGE ________ ###


### Problems ###

When browsing the "Problems" directory, each problem will have 
an output.txt file which contains all the information about the 
solutions. 

These output.txt will refer to figures in the same folder if 
these are a part of the solution.




### Exam ###

The "Exam" directory contains a solution of exam problem 11:

	"Multidimensional pseudo-random (plain Monte Carlo) vs quasi-random 
		(Halton and/or lattice sequence) integrators"

since the last two digits of my student ID number is 78 and 
there are 22 problems begining with exam problem 0 and ending 
with exam problem 21, so a student with 22 as the last digits
will get the 22nd problem, which is exam problem 21.

11 is thus the result of the calculation (78 mod 22) - 1 = 11
We need to subtract 1 at the end because the numbering starts at 0.

(It has been pointed out to me that I really should have made
exam problem 12 after all, but I have been given permission to
hand in the solution to exam problem 11 anyways)

The "Exam" directory is like the other problems in the "Problems"
directory, so a file called output.txt explains the solution and 
refers to the necessary figures. There is also generated a file
called report.pdf using latex, which explains results and contains
the figures. 

Because of the large amount of data necessary to produce the plots
for the solution, the 'make' command takes around 10 minutes on my
own hardware. I have chosen this amount of data to better see the
the difference between the convergence rates.




### Exercises ###

The "Exercises" directory contains the exercises from the course 
and the solutions are not self-explanatory. 

One should rather have the exercises at hand to know what questions 
my solutions are answering. 

Some of the solutions will be in files named out.txt and other 
solutions will merely be indicative plots








### ________ TO LIGHTEN THE MOOD ________ ###


In case the reader isn't excited over the numerical implementations in this directory,
here are the lyrics to Baby Shark:
