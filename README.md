##### Working directory for Practical Programming and Numerical Methods #####


### ________ SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS ________ ###


To use this directory, one must meet following software requirement:

- GNU make
- Csharp mono
- Gnuplot
- GCC (for the "Exercises" directory)
- latex

If something doesn't function properly, consider updating these
softwares




### ________ INSTRUCTIONS FOR USAGE ________ ###


### Problems ###

When browsing the "Problems" directory, each problem will have an output.txt file
which contains all the information about the solutions. 

These output.txt will refer to figures in the same folder if these are a part 
of the solution.




### Exam ###

The "Exam" directory contains a solution of exam problem 11:

		"Multidimensional pseudo-random (plain Monte Carlo) vs quasi-random 
			(Halton and/or lattice sequence) integrators"

since the last two digits of my student ID number is 78 and 
there are 22 problems begining with exam problem 0 and ending 
with exam problem 21, so a student with 22 as the last digits
will get the 22nd problem, which is exam problem 21.

11 is thus the result of the calculation (78 mod 22) - 1 = 11
We need to subtract 1 at the end because the numbering starts at 0.

(It has been pointed out to me that I really should have made
exam problem 12 after all, but I have been given permission to
hand in the solution to exam problem 11 anyways)

The "Exam" directory is like the other problems in the "Problems"
directory, so a file called output.txt explains the solution and 
refers to the necessary figures.




### Exercises ###

The "Exercises" directory contains the exercises from the course and the solutions
are not self-explanatory. 

One should rather have the exercises at hand to know what
questions my solutions are answering. 

Some of the solutions will be in files named
out.txt or output.txt and other solutions will merely be indicative plots
