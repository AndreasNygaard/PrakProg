_____ Assignment A _____
The solution of u''=-u with u(0)=0 can be seen in the figure Sin.svg
It shows the single-derivative Cosine as well.



_____ Assignment B _____
We choose the parameters 
N=5800000, Tc=4, Tr=10 
for the Covid-19 epidemic in Denmark. 
The results are seen in the figure SIR.svg

The figures Tc_2.svg and Tc_6.svg shows the same 
calculation, but for different times between contact.

As we can see from the figures, the 'Infectious' 
curve flattens as we increase Tc, because the virus 
is not spread as easily. We also end up with fewer 
removed at the end, and thus fewer infected overall.
