______ Assignment A ______

We use the linear interpolator to interpolate between points of 
a cosine. The interpolation is seen in the figure Linterp.svg
The figure also shows the estimated antiderivative.

We esimate the integral from x=-4 to x=π of the cosine to -0.741904357028968
The exact value of the integral is ∫[-4,π]dx cos(x) = sin(4) = -0.756802495307928




______ Assignment B ______

We use the quadratic interpolator to interpolate between points of a linear 
and a quadratic function: f(x) = 3*x + 2  and  f(x) = 4*x^2 + 7*x - 2 
The corresponding plots can be seen in the figure Qinterp.svg
We can see that antiderivatives are estimated well, while the derivative
only shows the correct tendencies.

We esimate the integral from x=-4 to x=2 of the linear function to -6
The exact value of the integral is ∫[-4,2]dx 3*x+2 = -6

We esimate the integral from x=-4 to x=2 of the quadratic function to 44.09166040571
The exact value of the integral is ∫[-4,2]dx 4*x^2+7*x-2 = 42




______ Assignment C ______

We use the cubic interpolator to interpolate between points of a function: 
f(x) = cos(3*x - 2) * (x^3 - 50*x)

The corresponding plots can be seen in the figure Cinterp.svg along with a 
spline from Gnuplot. We can see that the cubic spline from Gnuplot agrees with my own.

We esimate the integral from x=-4 to x=0 of the function to 44.5666007541898
The exact value of the integral is ∫[-4,2]dx cos(3*x-2)*(x^3-50*x) = 48.17134062
