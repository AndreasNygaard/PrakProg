______ Assignment A ______

Testing rootfinding with simple functions:

root of f(x)=2x-1 with starting point x0=1:       0.5 
root of f(x)=5x^2-7x+1 with starting point x0=1:      1.24 
root of f(x)=5x^2-7x+1 with starting point x0=0:     0.161 

All of these fit the analytical results.


Finding extremums of the 'Rosenbrock's valley function (RVF)':

We must look for roots of the gradient
root of gradient of RVF with starting point (x0,y0)=(0,0):         1          1 
f(root)=  8.99e-08  -5.06e-08 
eps            = 0.0001
f(root).norm() = 1.03214798240736E-07
test passed



______ Assignment B ______

Solutions with different r_max:


rmax = 2 Bohr radii
root of M(e)=0:    -0.125 

rmax = 3 Bohr radii
root of M(e)=0:    -0.424 

rmax = 5 Bohr radii
root of M(e)=0:    -0.496 

rmax = 10 Bohr radii
root of M(e)=0:      -0.5 

The figures Energy.svg and S-wave.svg shows the energy and s-wave 
function for the different r_max along with the exact solutions.
We see that we must have a rather high (~10) r_max to 
get the correct solution



______ Assignment C ______

We can see the convergence of the solution as a function of r_max 
in the plots Energy.svg and S-wave.svg. These have been made 
using the simple boundary condition.

Solutions with different r_max and better boundary condition:


rmax = 1 Bohr radii
root of M(e)=0:      -0.5 

rmax = 2 Bohr radii
root of M(e)=0:      -0.5 

rmax = 3 Bohr radii
root of M(e)=0:      -0.5 

rmax = 5 Bohr radii
root of M(e)=0:      -0.5 

In the figures Energy_improve.svg and S-wave_improve.svg, 
we see the results with a better boundary condition. 
We can see that we do not need as high an r_max as before, since we 
track the exact solution for any r_max until r_max is reached.
