______ Assignment A ______

Testing Monte Carlo integrator:

Second-degree polynomial, ∫[0,8]dx 4*x^2 - 6*x + 8:

Number of points N = 1000
The integral is estimated to 538.104960450399
Exact integral is 554.666666666667
The estimated error is 15.3414250137844
The exact error is 16.5617062162678

Number of points N = 100000
The integral is estimated to 548.643991515098
Exact integral is 554.666666666667
The estimated error is 1.5896579349716
The exact error is 6.02267515156848


Himmelblau's function, ∫[0,6]dx ∫[0,6]dy (x^2+y-11)^2 + (x+y^2-7)^2:

Number of points N = 100000
The integral is estimated to 11446.1922117056
Exact integral is 11390.4
The estimated error is 40.6716286983267
The exact error is 55.7922117056114

We see that we get a better result using more points, and the 
result converges towards the exact result.


Difficult singular integral, ∫[0,π]dx ∫[0,π]dy ∫[0,π]dz 1/[(1-cos(x)*cos(y)*cos(z)) * π^3]:

Number of points N = 500000
The integral is estimated to 1.3899139333371
Exact integral is 1.39320392968568
The estimated error is 0.00930565323480177
The exact error is 0.00328999634857574




______ Assignment B ______

We will use the Himmelblau's function to test the error as a function of N.

The result is seen in the figure Error.svg. We clearly see that the estimated
error drops as 1/√N, and the actual error does as well to some extend.



______ Assignment C ______

We estimate the integral of the difficult singular function using recursive 
stratified sampling

Number of points N = 500000
The integral is estimated to 1.39302931697472
Exact integral is 1.39320392968568
The estimated error is 0.00303299269660099
The exact error is 0.000174612710954758


We estimate the area of circle with radius 0.9 by integrating 
over a constant circular function.

The area is estimated to 2.83317132045784

The stratified points can be seen in the figure Strat.svg
