______ Assignment A ______

Testing Monte Carlo integrator:

Second-degree polynomial, ∫[0,8]dx 4*x^2 - 6*x + 8:

Number of points N = 1000
The integral is estimated to 528.446882266919
Exact integral is 554.666666666667
The estimated error is 15.4337992695703
The exact error is 26.2197843997474

Number of points N = 100000
The integral is estimated to 552.19877854786
Exact integral is 554.666666666667
The estimated error is 1.59231531634031
The exact error is 2.46788811880617


Himmelblau's function, ∫[0,6]dx ∫[0,6]dy (x^2+y-11)^2 + (x+y^2-7)^2:

Number of points N = 100000
The integral is estimated to 11419.5350543705
Exact integral is 11390.4
The estimated error is 40.5032072463702
The exact error is 29.1350543704557

We see that we get a better result using more points, and the 
result converges towards the exact result.


Difficult singular integral, ∫[0,π]dx ∫[0,π]dy ∫[0,π]dz 1/[(1-cos(x)*cos(y)*cos(z)) * π^3]:

Number of points N = 500000
The integral is estimated to 1.41227792363524
Exact integral is 1.39320392968568
The estimated error is 0.0198681816958803
The exact error is 0.0190739939495661




______ Assignment B ______

We will use the Himmelblau's function to test the error as a function of N.

The result is seen in the figure Error.svg. We clearly see that the estimated
error drops as 1/√N, and the actual error does as well to some extend.



______ Assignment C ______

We estimate the integral of the difficult singular function using recursive 
stratified sampling

Number of points N = 500000
The integral is estimated to 1.39302931697472
Exact integral is 1.39320392968568
The estimated error is 0.00303299269660099
The exact error is 0.000174612710954758


We estimate the area of circle with radius 0.9 by integrating 
over a constant circular function.

The area is estimated to 2.83317132045784

The stratified points can be seen in the figure Strat.svg
