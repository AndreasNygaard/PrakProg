______ Assignment A ______

Testing Monte Carlo integrator:

Second-degree polynomial, ∫[0,8]dx 4*x^2 - 6*x + 8:

Number of points N = 1000
The integral is estimated to 538.595990261298
Exact integral is 554.666666666667
The estimated error is 15.88211387865
The exact error is 16.0706764053682

Number of points N = 100000
The integral is estimated to 552.136472514359
Exact integral is 554.666666666667
The estimated error is 1.59210838304788
The exact error is 2.53019415230813


Himmelblau's function, ∫[0,6]dx ∫[0,6]dy (x^2+y-11)^2 + (x+y^2-7)^2:

Number of points N = 100000
The integral is estimated to 11337.0869446794
Exact integral is 11390.4
The estimated error is 40.409507539248
The exact error is 53.3130553206174

We see that we get a better result using more points, and the 
result converges towards the exact result.


Difficult singular integral, ∫[0,π]dx ∫[0,π]dy ∫[0,π]dz 1/[(1-cos(x)*cos(y)*cos(z)) * π^3]:

Number of points N = 500000
The integral is estimated to 1.38654581296484
Exact integral is 1.39320392968568
The estimated error is 0.01153842276041
The exact error is 0.00665811672083838




______ Assignment B ______

We will use the Himmelblau's function to test the error as a function of N.

The result is seen in the figure Error.svg. We clearly see that the estimated
error drops as 1/√N, and the actual error does as well to some extend.



______ Assignment C ______

We estimate the integral of the difficult singular function using recursive 
stratified sampling

Number of points N = 500000
The integral is estimated to 1.39302931697472
Exact integral is 1.39320392968568
The estimated error is 0.00303299269660099
The exact error is 0.000174612710954758


We estimate the area of a circle with radius 2 by integrating 
over a constant circular function.

We are using N = 25000 points
The area is estimated to 12.5801329969934
The exact area is 4π = 12.5663706143592
The estimated error is 0.0143497513151148
The exact error is 0.0137623826342388

The stratified points can be seen in the figure Strat.svg

With plain MC and 25000 points, we get the integral 12.671
The estimated error is 0.0790495437051979
The exact error is 0.104629385640827
