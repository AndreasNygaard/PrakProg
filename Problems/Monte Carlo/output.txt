______ Assignment A ______

Testing Monte Carlo integrator:

Second-degree polynomial, ∫[0,8]dx 4*x^2 - 6*x + 8:

Number of points N = 1000
The integral is estimated to 540.561215279937
Exact integral is 554.666666666667
The estimated error is 15.9053228978707
The exact error is 14.1054513867292

Number of points N = 100000
The integral is estimated to 556.311859250833
Exact integral is 554.666666666667
The estimated error is 1.59692254497574
The exact error is 1.64519258416681


Himmelblau's function, ∫[0,6]dx ∫[0,6]dy (x^2+y-11)^2 + (x+y^2-7)^2:

Number of points N = 100000
The integral is estimated to 11407.5669602732
Exact integral is 11390.4
The estimated error is 40.6395312932858
The exact error is 17.1669602732254

We see that we get a better result using more points, and the 
result converges towards the exact result.


Difficult singular integral, ∫[0,π]dx ∫[0,π]dy ∫[0,π]dz 1/[(1-cos(x)*cos(y)*cos(z)) * π^3]:

Number of points N = 500000
The integral is estimated to 1.38595047523603
Exact integral is 1.39320392968568
The estimated error is 0.00831960339697118
The exact error is 0.00725345444964653




______ Assignment B ______

We will use the Himmelblau's function to test the error as a function of N.

The result is seen in the figure Error.svg. We clearly see that the estimated
error drops as 1/√N, and the actual error does as well to some extend.



______ Assignment C ______

We estimate the integral of the difficult singular function using recursive 
stratified sampling

Number of points N = 500000
The integral is estimated to 1.39302931697472
Exact integral is 1.39320392968568
The estimated error is 0.00303299269660099
The exact error is 0.000174612710954758


We estimate the area of a circle with radius 2 by integrating 
over a constant circular function.

We are using N = 25000 points
The area is estimated to 12.5801329969934
The exact area is 4π = 12.5663706143592
The estimated error is 0.0143497513151148
The exact error is 0.0137623826342388

The stratified points can be seen in the figure Strat.svg

With plain MC and 25000 points, we get the integral 12.584
The estimated error is 0.079055156441563
The exact error is 0.0176293856408289
