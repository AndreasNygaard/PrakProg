Fitted exponential function:
y(t)=142.4·exp(-0.171·t)

A plot of this fit is seen in A.svg


The half-life of ThX is found to be 4.04451793348687 days



____Assignment B____
Covariance matrix:
   0.00089   8.75e-05 
  8.75e-05   1.25e-05 

Fitted exponential function with errors on coefficients:
y(t)=[142.4 ± 4.249]·exp(-[0.171 ± 0.0035]·t)


Errors on fit-coefficients in y(t)=a·exp(-k·t):

a = (142.404080608249 ± 4.24898502806152) % activity
k = (0.171379430616683 ± 0.00353553390593274) days^(-1)

Half-life of ThX with uncertainty is (4.045 ± 0.08344) days

The modern value of the half-life is 3.66 days, and this is not within our uncertainty



____Assignment C____
We plot four additional fits, each corrected with an uncertainty of a coefficient

These fits are as follows:
y(t)=[142.4 + 4.249]·exp(-0.171·t)
y(t)=[142.4 - 4.249]·exp(-0.171·t)
y(t)=142.4·exp(-[0.171 + 0.0035]·t)
y(t)=142.4·exp(-[0.171 - 0.0035]·t)

A plot of these fits are seen in C.svg
