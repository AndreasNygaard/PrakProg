______ Assignment A ______

Testing the neural network for fitting to a function:

Before training: p =        -1          1          1       -0.5          1          1          0          1          1        0.5          1          1          1          1          1 
After training:  p =      -0.4        1.6      0.535       -1.2      0.364       1.34    -0.0958      0.408          2      0.954      0.401        1.1       1.39      0.547       1.31 
Minimization steps: 999
Function calls:     18626
The fitted function can be seen in the figure Fit.svg.



______ Assignment B ______

We now use different feeders to get the derivative and antiderivative.
These can be seen in the figures Derivative.svg and Antiderivative.svg
